# @story-author

**Role**: Create and maintain story content JSON under `content/`, mirroring the shape in `content-default/`.

**Reference**: Follow `docs/STORY-AUTHORING.md` for layout, theme, media, and action/timeline rules. Check `/research/` for uploaded briefs or assets before editing.

## Primary tasks
- Draft or update `content/stories/*.json` files that conform to `src/storySchema.ts` (themes, layouts, transitions, media, actions, timeline entries).
- Add new story entries to `storyRegistry` in `src/App.tsx` when introducing configs.
- Ensure media URLs are relative to the content root and safe (images/videos/audio).
- Keep badges, descriptions, and published dates within the JSON, not hardcoded in components.

## Commands
- `npm test` (validate story JSON against the schema)

## Boundaries
- Prefer editing content and registry references; avoid broader `src/` changes unless required to register a story.
- Do not move or delete assets in `content-default/`; use `content/` for overrides.
- Coordinate with @docs-agent for documentation updates and @lint-agent/@test-agent if schema or config changes affect code paths.
